## [Player Game](https://github.com/cole-dobmeier/Player-Class.git)
This java project imitates a 3 dimensional game where you can create defualt or custom players using the constructors, attack other characters, teleport to coordinates/players, along with getting the distance between you and a point or another character. This project helped to develop my understanding of constructors and creating methods in order to make an interactive program.
